creating mainScreen , mainMapScreen , creating modules , creating services , linking the app with Google Cloud Platform , creating the API KEY , generating Google Maps , Validate the input field when searching in the map , creating functions that show you the routes between location and destination . linking between classes : Station and Voyage .


I've tried to use Google polylines packages and API , but the API wasn't for free , they requested credits and that's why i didn't get through with it .
also i had problems with the Geolocator packages.
